// Welcome to Cypress!

// This spec file contains a variety of sample tests

// the power of writing tests in Cypress.
//
// To learn more about how Cypress works and
// what makes it such an awesome testing tool,
// please read our getting started guide:

    // we include it in our beforeEach function so that it runs before each test
